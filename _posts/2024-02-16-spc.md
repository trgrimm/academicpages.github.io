This post gives a basic overview of fault detection with statistical process control (SPC) methods, also referred to as statistical process monitoring (SPM).

# What is fault detection?

In many processes, such as industrial, manufacturing, chemical, water/wastewater treatment, etc., it is important to identify and quickly respond to any abnormal changes, outliers, or anomalies ("faults") in the process that may damage process equipment or negatively impact environmental or human health.

Some examples of faults include:
* Sensor failure
* Unexpected changes in process behavior
* Degradation of sensors or mechanical devices over time

*Fault detection* is the process by which faults are identified ("detected"). Many methods for fault detection exist, including various supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. However, these methods can often be difficult to fit or interpret, especially when a large amount of data is not available in advance. Another approach is to use SPC methods, which are a more traditional statistical solution that are typically much easier, faster, and more interpretable, often without sacrificing much (if any) fault detection performance.
