This post gives a brief introduction to the basics of fault detection with statistical process control (SPC), also referred to as statistical process monitoring (SPM).

# What is fault detection?

In many processes, such as industrial, manufacturing, chemical, water/wastewater treatment, etc., it is important to identify and quickly respond to any abnormal changes in the process that may damage process equipment or negatively impact environmental or human health.

**Fault detection** is the process by which outliers/anomalies ("faults") are identified ("detected").
