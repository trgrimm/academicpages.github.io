About Me
======

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at Baylor University with a passion for understanding and learning from data to help others make informed decisions.

As an undergraduate, I worked for a year as a research assistant developing Bayesian models to estimate elemental profiles and contributions of various potential pollution sources across the intermountain west. This project resulted in my first co-authored [publication](https://trgrimm.github.io/publications/).

While at Baylor, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of different projects that have helped me develop my skills as a statistician and data scientist. As part of my duties as a graduate assistant at Baylor, I:

* assisted in the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry.
* worked as a statistical consultant studying and applying various statistical methods to help clients understand their data on a case-by-case basis.

Currently, I am working with my advisor, [Dr. Mandy Hering](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/dr-amanda-s-hering), to improve multivariate statistical methods for fault detection in complex processes with specific applications in water/wastewater treatment.
