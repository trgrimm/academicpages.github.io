About Me
======

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at Baylor University with a passion for understanding and learning from data to help others make informed decisions. I especially love collaborating with people with different backgrounds and learning about other fields so that I can better understand and approach problems.

As an undergraduate, I worked for a year as a research assistant developing Bayesian models to estimate elemental profiles and contributions of various potential pollution sources across the intermountain west. This project resulted in my first co-authored [publication](https://trgrimm.github.io/publications/).

While at Baylor, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of different projects that have helped me develop my skills as a statistician and data scientist. As part of my duties as a graduate assistant at Baylor, I:

* assisted in the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry.
* worked as a statistical consultant studying and applying various statistical methods to help clients understand their data on a case-by-case basis.

Currently, I am working with my advisor, [Dr. Mandy Hering](https://statistics.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/dr-amanda-s-hering), to improve multivariate statistical methods for detecting faults (anomalies) in complex processes, with specific applications in water/wastewater treatment.

Through my coursework and research, I have gained experience with a wide variety of methods and technologies, including:

* popular machine learning methods (KNN, random forests, XGBoost, neural networks, etc.)
* statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian methods, generalized linear models, time series)
* R (tidyverse, R Shiny, etc.), SQL, SAS, Python (sklearn, pandas, etc.)
